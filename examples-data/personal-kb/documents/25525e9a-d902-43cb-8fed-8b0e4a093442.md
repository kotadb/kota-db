# AI Cognition and Knowledge Representation

Exploring how AI systems can effectively represent and manipulate knowledge.

## Key Challenges
1. **Grounding Problem**: Connecting symbols to real-world meaning
2. **Frame Problem**: What changes and what stays the same
3. **Symbol Grounding**: How do symbols acquire meaning?

## Representation Approaches

### Symbolic AI
- Logic-based systems (Prolog, CLIPS)
- Semantic networks
- Frames and schemas
- Production rule systems

### Connectionist AI
- Neural networks for pattern recognition
- Distributed representations
- Emergent behavior from simple rules
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity

### Hybrid Approaches
- Neuro-symbolic integration
- Knowledge graphs with embeddings
- Differentiable programming
- Causal reasoning with neural networks

## KotaDB's Approach
- Documents as first-class knowledge units
- Multiple index types for different reasoning patterns
- Human-readable format for interpretability
- Temporal awareness for knowledge evolution
