# Understanding Rust Ownership

Rust's ownership system is what makes it memory-safe without garbage collection.

## Key Concepts

### Ownership Rules
1. Each value has a single owner
2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
3. Ownership can be transferred (moved)

### Borrowing
- References allow you to use values without taking ownership
- Immutable references: `&T`
- Mutable references: `&mut T`

## Example
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    takes_ownership(s); // s is moved here
    // s is no longer valid
}

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // some_string goes out of scope and is dropped
```
