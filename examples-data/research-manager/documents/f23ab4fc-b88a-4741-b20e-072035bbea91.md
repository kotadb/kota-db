## Abstract
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of distributed consensus algorithms, from classical Paxos to modern Raft and beyond. We analyze theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and performance characteristics across different failure models.

## Key Contributions
1. Taxonomy of consensus algorithms by failure model
2. Performance comparison under various network conditions  
3. Implementation complexity analysis
4. Future research directions

## Notes
- Excellent overview of Raft vs Paxos trade-offs
- Good performance data for network partition scenarios
- Missing coverage of Byzantine fault tolerant algorithms
- Useful for understanding consensus landscape
