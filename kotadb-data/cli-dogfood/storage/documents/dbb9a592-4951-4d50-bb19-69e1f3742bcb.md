# Contributing to KotaDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing to KotaDB! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (managed via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Git
- Basic understanding of database concepts and Rust

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayminwest/kota-db.git
   cd kota-db
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Rust toolchain is automatically installed via rust-toolchain.toml
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   ./run_standalone.sh test
   ```

4. **Run Demo**
   ```bash
   ./run_standalone.sh demo
   ```

## Architecture Principles

KotaDB follows a **6-stage risk reduction methodology**:

1. **Test-Driven Development** - Tests written before implementation
2. **Contract-First Design** - Clear interfaces and preconditions
3. **Pure Function Modularization** - Business logic separated from I/O
4. **Comprehensive Observability** - Full tracing and metrics
5. **Adversarial Testing** - Edge cases and failure scenarios
6. **Component Library** - Validated types and automatic best practices

### Key Design Patterns

- **Validated Types**: Invalid states are unrepresentable
- **Builder Patterns**: Fluent APIs with sensible defaults
- **Wrapper Components**: Automatic cross-cutting concerns (caching, tracing, retries)
- **Pure Functions**: Predictable, testable business logic
- **Contract Validation**: Runtime precondition and postcondition checking

## Development Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
Before starting work, create an issue describing:
- Problem statement or feature request
- Proposed solution approach
- Expected impact and risks
- Testing strategy

### 2. Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Create bugfix branch  
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# Create MCP integration branch
git checkout -b mcp/component-name
```

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Style
- Follow Rust standard formatting (`cargo fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation for public APIs
- Include examples in documentation

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for workflows
- Property-based tests for algorithms
- Performance regression tests

#### Error Handling
- Use `anyhow::Result` for general errors
- Create specific error types for domain errors
- Never use `unwrap()` in production code
- Provide helpful error messages

#### Performance
- Benchmark performance-critical code
- Use the metrics infrastructure for monitoring
- Follow the Stage 6 component patterns
- Cache frequently accessed data

### 4. Commit Guidelines

Follow conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

Examples:
```bash
feat(mcp): add semantic search tool for LLM integration
fix(storage): resolve memory leak in bulk operations
docs(api): add examples for document builder patterns
test(index): add property tests for B+ tree operations
```
