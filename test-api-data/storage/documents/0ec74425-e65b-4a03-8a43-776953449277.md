  - `GET /api/analysis/impact/:target` - Analyze impact of changes to a component
  - `GET /api/code/search` - Full-text code search using trigram indexing
  - All endpoints use BinaryRelationshipEngine for <10ms query latency
  - Proper JSON responses with performance metrics included
  - Thread-safe async implementation using spawn_blocking for HTTP handlers
- New `create_server_with_intelligence()` and `start_server_with_intelligence()` functions
  - Initialize server with codebase intelligence support
  - Automatically sets up BinaryRelationshipEngine and trigram indexing
  - Provides detailed logging of available API endpoints on startup
- Deprecation headers for legacy document CRUD endpoints
  - Added RFC-compliant deprecation headers (Deprecation, Sunset, Link, Warning)
  - Clear migration path to new codebase intelligence API
  - Sunset date set to 3 months from implementation

### Fixed
- Fixed test coverage calculation in `codebase-overview` showing incorrect 8% instead of actual coverage (#488)
  - Now uses proper algorithm based on test-to-code file ratio with tanh curve
  - Only counts files with extracted symbols for accurate ratios
- Fixed `analyze-impact` command returning 0 results despite having relationships (#488)
  - Now correctly searches all symbol instances across the codebase
  - Aggregates impact from all occurrences of the target symbol
- Improved `find-callers` and `analyze-impact` result limits (#488)
  - Increased default limit from 50 to 10,000 results
  - Added prominent warning when results are truncated
  - Implemented `--limit 0` for unlimited results
  - Clear instructions in warning message for adjusting limits

### Removed
- Railway deployment support - migrated to Fly.io (#510)
  - Removed `railway.toml` configuration file
  - Removed `scripts/check-railway-status.sh`
  - **Migration**: Use Fly.io deployment instead (see docs/FLY_DEPLOYMENT.md)
  - **Rationale**: Railway had persistent container restart issues, GLIBC incompatibilities, and limited debugging capabilities
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed natural language query parser (#445)
  - Removed `RelationshipQuery` CLI command that supported natural language queries
  - Removed `natural_language_query` module and all NL parsing functions
  - Removed `parse_natural_language_relationship_query` function from relationship_query module
  - Natural language patterns like "what calls X?" are no longer supported
  - **Migration**: Use direct commands instead:
    - Replace "what calls X?" with `find-callers X`
    - Replace "what would break if I change X?" with `analyze-impact X`
    - Replace "find unused functions" with direct symbol queries
  - **Rationale**: The NL parser was limited (only 2 patterns), created false expectations, and added complexity for minimal benefit
  - Direct commands are clearer, more predictable, and have better error messages

### Added

- LLM-optimized search output with progressive disclosure (#370)
  - New `--context` flag for search command with levels: none, minimal, medium, full

  - Smart context extraction shows complete semantic code blocks
  - Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelming LLM context windows
  - Integrated existing LLMSearchEngine for sophisticated relevance scoring
- CI failure investigation and improvements to ensure all checks pass reliably
- `--verbose` flag for CLI operations to enable detailed logging output (#335)
  - Default logging level set to WARN for clean agent-friendly output
  - Use `--verbose` or `-v` to enable INFO level logging for progress visibility
  - RUST_LOG environment variable still overrides all settings for debugging
- `--limit` flag for find-callers and impact-analysis commands (#335)
  - Allows limiting the number of results returned for better readability
  - Prevents overwhelming output when analyzing symbols with many dependencies
- Binary trigram index implementation for high-performance search (#311)
  - New `--binary-index` flag enables 10x faster index operations
  - Uses bincode serialization instead of JSON for compact storage
  - Implements memory-mapped file access for zero-copy operations
  - Reduces index size by 3-5x compared to JSON format
  - Target: Achieve <10ms query latency (previously 580ms)

### Fixed

  - Fixed WAL (Write-Ahead Log) operations to support new edge update/delete variants
- CLI text search functionality for programming-related terms (#345)
  - Fixed over-aggressive query sanitization that blocked legitimate search terms
  - Words like "script", "javascript", "select", "insert", "create" now work correctly
  - Made SQL injection protection more precise to target actual injection patterns
  - Preserved security against real SQL injection and XSS attacks
- CLI logging verbosity issues that impacted agent/LLM workflows (#335)
  - Changed default logging level from DEBUG to WARN for cleaner output
  - Eliminated excessive trace output that buried useful information
  - CLI now produces clean, parseable output by default without RUST_LOG=warn
- Wildcard pattern matching in search functionality (#335)
  - Fixed routing of wildcard queries (e.g., "*.rs", "*Controller.rs") to primary index
  - Implemented proper glob pattern matching for path-based searches
  - Wildcard patterns now correctly filter results based on file paths
- Symbol storage directory not being created automatically (#272)

  - Fixed validation false positive showing primary index limited to 1000 documents
    - Increased query limits from 1000 to 100,000 throughout the codebase
    - Updated ValidationConfig defaults to handle larger repositories
  - Fixed trigram index returning 0 documents for wildcard queries
    - Added support for wildcard queries (empty search terms) in trigram index
    - Trigram index now returns all indexed documents for validation queries
  - Added comprehensive test suite to reproduce and validate the fixes
  - This resolves issues where search validation failed for repositories with >1000 documents
- Critical trigram index bug where insert() method was not indexing actual document content (#249)
  - Changed insert() to return error directing users to insert_with_content()
  - Fixed unit test to use insert_with_content() for proper content indexing
